# QuickSell

## General information about the website

- QuickSell is a web-application that is heavily inspired by the Norwegian marketplace, Finn.no. The purpose of this project is not to deliver a competitor by any means, but rather learn and demonstrate fundamental concepts and ideas in full-stack web-development using industry-standard tools.

- The general idea is to allow users to post and view personal/owned items. The idea is to divide the application into categories (much like Finn.no), but for now only 'general-items' is implemented and functional. The project also includes user authentication which allows users to create a user and log in.

A logged in user get these benefits:
1. Access to 'my-page'
2. Allowed to create, update and delete posted items.
3. Submit bids to items posted by other users.
4. Manage bids that the user has submitted to other items.
5. Update and manage user credentials.
